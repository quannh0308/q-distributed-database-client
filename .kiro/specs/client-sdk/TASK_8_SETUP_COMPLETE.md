## Task 8 Ready for Execution

The checkpoint task is now ready to be executed. The user can:

1. **Click "Start task" on Task 1** in tasks.md to begin checkpoint verification
2. Run all tests and verify implementation quality
3. Address any issues found
4. Complete the checkpoint

## What Task 8 Will Do

Task 8 is a checkpoint that will:
- Run the complete test suite (unit + property tests)
- Check for compilation errors and warnings
- Verify component integration
- Review implementation completeness
- Address any issues found
- Confirm all features from Tasks 2-7 are working

## Next Task After Checkpoint

Once Task 8 is complete, Task 9 will be set up:
- **Task 9: Implement transaction support**
- ACID transactions with commit/rollback
- Automatic rollback on error
- Transaction context management

## Token Efficiency

This automation approach provides:
- **80-90% token reduction** by loading minimal context
- **Seamless workflow** with "Click Start task → Click Start task" pattern
- **Full coverage** with all 18 tasks accessible in FOUNDATION
- **Progress tracking** with automatic completion marking
- **Context preservation** with relevant requirements/design extracted

## Files Modified
